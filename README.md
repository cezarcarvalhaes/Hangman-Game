# Star Wars Hangman-Game

This StarWars-themed Hangman game was developed by Cezar Carvalhaes in 2018.

Press Enter to play:

A hidden word will appear with the number of '_' representing the length of the word. 

Guess a letter by typing on your keyboard. Correct guesses will pop up inside the hidden word. Letters typed will be logged at the bottom so you can keep track of guesses.

Guesses are limited, if you don't get the word within 7 incorrect guesses, you lose!

May the force be with you.
